For a current list of supported browsers, versions, and operating systems, see [Amazon Chime SDK system requirements](meetings-sdk.md#mtg-browsers)\. The [developer guide and FAQs on Github](https://github.com/aws/amazon-chime-sdk-js/issues/1059) address browser and other compatibility issues\. Also, familiarize yourself with the [known browser issues](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-js/modules/faqs.html#known-browser-issues) on GitHub and any workarounds\.
