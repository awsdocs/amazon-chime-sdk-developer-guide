# Creating a channel flow<a name="create-channel-flow"></a>

Once you have processor\(s\) setup, you use the Amazon Chime SDK Messaging APIs to create a channel flow\. You can use a `Fallback` action to define whether to stop or continue processing if the channel flow can't connect to the processor Lambda function\. If a processor has a fallback action of `ABORT`, the processor sets the message status to `FAILED`, and it doesn't send the message\. Note that if the last processor in the channel flow sequence has a fallback action of `CONTINUE`, the message is considered processed and sent to recipients in the channel\. Once you create a channel flow, you can associate it with individual channels\. For more information, refer to the [CreateChannelFlow](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime-sdk/latest/APIReference/API_messaging-chime_CreateChannelFlow.html) API documentation\.
