# Components of an Amazon Chime SDK application<a name="components"></a>

To embed real\-time audio, video, and screen\-sharing capabilities into your Amazon Chime SDK applications, you use these components:
+ **The Amazon Chime SDK client library for JavaScript**, the client\-side SDK that you integrate into your browser or Electron web application\. You do that by adding the [ Amazon Chime SDK for JavaScript NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/amazon-chime-sdk-js) as a dependency\. This package leverages the [ MediaDevices](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices) and [ WebRTC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API) APIs to join meetings and exchange audio, video, and to share content with other attendees\. It gives you a control surface for managing the different types of media and the ability to bind those resources to your application's user interfaces\.
+ **The AWS SDK**, the Amazon Chime SDK API that your server application uses to authenticate and authorize meeting requests from your web application\. The AWS SDK gives you API actions such as [ chime:CreateMeeting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime-sdk/latest/APIReference/API_CreateMeeting.html) and [ chime:CreateAttendee](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime-sdk/latest/APIReference/API_CreateAttendee.html) to create and manage meeting and attendee resources\.

   Like any other AWS resource, the Amazon Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) service configures access to these actions\. The AWS SDK is available in [ several programming languages](http://aws.amazon.com/tools/) and takes the complexity out of calling the AWS SDK Chime API from your server application\. If your application does not currently use a server application, you can start with the AWS CloudFormation template included in the [ demos/serverless](https://github.com/aws/amazon-chime-sdk-js/tree/master/demos/serverless) folder\. That demo shows you how to build an AWS Lambda\-based serverless application that uses the AWS SDK Chime API\. 
+ **Amazon Chime SDK media services** provides the audio, video, and signaling that the Amazon Chime SDK client library for JavaScript uses to connect to meetings\. Media services are available globally to support audio mixing, video forwarding, and NAT traversal using TURN relays\. The Amazon Chime service team deploys, monitors, and manages these services\. The media services are hosted in a single range of IP addresses – 99\.77\.128\.0/18 – and use ports TCP/443 and UDP/3478 to simplify firewall configurations for IT administrators\. Finally, these services leverage the [AWS Global Cloud Infrastructure](http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/)\.
