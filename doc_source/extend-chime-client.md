# Extending the Amazon Chime desktop client<a name="extend-chime-client"></a>

Developers can extend the capabilities of the Amazon Chime desktop client by adding chat bots, proxy phone sessions, and webhooks\. Chat bots enable users to perform tasks such as querying internal systems for information\. Proxy phone sessions allow users to call and send texts without revealing their phone numbers\. Webhooks can automatically send messages to chat rooms\. For example, a webhook can send meeting reminders to a team, along with a link to the meeting\.
