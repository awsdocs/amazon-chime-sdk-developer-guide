# Creating an Amazon S3 bucket<a name="create-s3-bucket"></a>

The Amazon S3 bucket for your media capture pipeline must belong to the same AWS account as the Amazon Chime SDK meeting\. In addition, you must give the `s3:PutObject` and `s3:PutObjectAcl` permission to the Amazon Chime SDK service principal [mediapipelines\.chime\.amazonaws\.com](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.html)\. You can do that with the Amazon S3 console or the AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\)\. The S3 bucket must belong to one of the available [Amazon Chime SDK media Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime-sdk/latest/dg/sdk-available-regions.html)\.

The following example shows an Amazon S3 bucket policy\.
