# What is Amazon WorkDocs?<a name="what_is"></a>

Amazon WorkDocs is a document storage, collaboration, and sharing system\. Amazon WorkDocs is fully managed, secure, and enterprise scale\. It provides strong administrative controls, plus feedback capabilities that help improve user productivity\. Files are stored in [the cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-computing/), safely and securely\. Your user's files are only visible to them, and their designated contributors and viewers\. Other members of your organization do not have access to other user's files unless they are specifically granted access\. 

Users can share their files with other members of your organization for collaboration or review\. The Amazon WorkDocs client applications can be used to view many different types of files, depending on the Internet media type of the file\. Amazon WorkDocs supports all common document and image formats, and support for additional media types is constantly being added\. 

For more information, see [Amazon WorkDocs](https://aws.amazon.com/workdocs/)\.
