# Checking the logs<a name="check-logs"></a>

If you're debugging a SIP media application, check the Cloudwatch logs for the AWS Lambda function associated with the application\. 

Next, check the logs associated with the SIP media application\. As needed, you can configure the SIP media application for logging\. For more information, see [Using SIP media applications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime-sdk/latest/ag/use-sip-apps.html) in the *Amazon Chime SDK Administrator Guide*\. If you enable logging, you can find the logs on Cloudwatch, in the /aws/ChimeSipMediaApplicationSipMessages/ *SIP media application Id* log group\.
