# Sending messages<a name="sending-msgs"></a>

You use the SendChannelMessage API to send messages to a channel\. For a channel associated with a channel flow, the processor assigns one of the following status values\.




| Message status | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| SENT | Message processed successfully\. | 
| PENDING | Ongoing processing\. | 
| FAILED | Processing failed because the processor Lambda function is unreachable\. | 
| DENIED | The message won't be sent\. | 

**Receiving intermediate status events**  
**Websocket events**

Websocket events are sent to a channel after they successfully establish a connection\. For more information, refer to [Using WebSockets to receive messages](websockets.md)\. 


| Event type | Status | Recipients | Notes | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| CREATE\_CHANNEL\_MESSAGE | SENT | All channel members | SendChannelMessage API with successful preprocessing | 
| UPDATE\_CHANNEL\_MESSAGE | SENT | All channel members | UpdateChannelMessage API with successful preprocessing | 
| PENDING\_CREATE\_CHANNEL\_MESSAGE | PENDING | Message sender only | SendChannelMessage API with ongoing preprocessing | 
| PENDING\_UPDATE\_CHANNEL\_MESSAGE | PENDING | Message sender only | UpdateChannelMessage API with ongoing preprocessing | 
| FAILED\_CREATE\_CHANNEL\_MESSAGE | FAILED | Message sender only | SendChannelMessage API with failed preprocessing | 
| FAILED\_UPDATE\_CHANNEL\_MESSAGE | FAILED | Message sender only | UpdateChannelMessage API with failed preprocessing | 
| DENIED\_CREATE\_CHANNEL\_MESSAGE | DENIED | Message sender only | SendChannelMessage API with processor denying the message | 
| DENIED\_UPDATE\_CHANNEL\_MESSAGE | DENIED | Message sender only | UpdateChannelMessage API with processor denying the message | 

**GetChannelMessageStatus API**  
This API provides an alternative way to retrieve message status if the event was not received due to a bad websocket connection\. For more information, refer to the [GetChannelMessageStatus](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime-sdk/latest/APIReference/API_messaging-chime_GetChannelMessageStatus.html) API documentation\.

**Note**  
This API does not return statuses for denied messages, because we don't store them\.
