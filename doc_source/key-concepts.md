# Key concepts<a name="key-concepts"></a>

To fully understand how to create and manage meetings and users, you need to understand these concepts:

 ** [Meeting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/APIReference/API_Meeting.html)** – A multi\-party media session\. Every meeting has a unique meeting identifier, and you create meetings in one of the supported AWS regions\. When you create a meeting, the APIs return a list of media URLs\. That's a key part of the data needed to join a meeting, and you need to disseminate that data to all users trying to join the meeting\.

 ** [Attendee](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/APIReference/API_Attendee.html)** – A user trying to join a multi\-party media session\. Every attendee has a unique identifier, an external user identifier that you can pass in to map the attendee to a user in your system, and a signed Join Token that grants the attendee access to the meeting\.

** [MeetingSession](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-js/interfaces/meetingsession.html)** \([DefaultMeetingSession](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-js/classes/defaultmeetingsession.html)\) – The root object of the Amazon Chime SDK for JavaScript that represents each user’s session in a meeting\. The web applications start by instantiating MeetingSession and configuring it with the correct meeting and attendee information\.

** [ MeetingSessionConfiguration ](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-js/classes/meetingsessionconfiguration.html) ** – Stores the meeting and attendee data needed to join a meeting session\. The data comes as the response of the [CreateMeeting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/APIReference/API_CreateMeeting.html) and [CreateAttendee](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/APIReference/API_CreateAttendee.html) API calls made by the server application\. This data is passed down from the server application to the web application and used to instantiate the MeetingSession\.

** [DeviceController](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-js/interfaces/devicecontroller.html) ** \([DefaultDeviceController](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-js/classes/defaultdevicecontroller.html)\) – Enables you to enumerate the list of available audio and video devices on a user's system\. You can also use the device controller during a meeting to switch the actively used devices\.

**[AudioVideoFacade](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-js/interfaces/audiovideofacade.html) ** \([DefaultAudioVideoFacade](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-js/classes/defaultaudiovideofacade.html)\) – The key interface that powers a meeting\. It provides APIs to start, control, and leave a meeting\. It also provides APIs to listen for the key events that drive user experience changes, such as a roster of attendees, by tracking users joining or leaving, being muted or unmuted, actively speaking, or having poor connectivity\. You can also use these APIs to bind the audio control HTML element to the meeting audio output and play it through the selected audio output device\.

**[ActiveSpeakerDetectorFacade](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-js/interfaces/activespeakerdetectorfacade.html) ** \([DefaultActiveSpeakerDetector](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-js/classes/defaultactivespeakerdetector.html)\) – Provides the API that subscribes to active speaker events\. Periodically returns a list of attendees ranked by their mic volume over a period of time\. You can override the active speaker policy as needed\.

**[ContentShareController](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-js/interfaces/contentsharecontroller.html) ** \([DefaultContentShareController](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-js/classes/defaultcontentsharecontroller.html)\) – Provides APIs to start\-stop and pause\-unpause the content sharing experience\. It also provides APIs for listening to lifecycle events that track content sharing status\.

**[Logger](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-js/interfaces/logger.html) ** \([ConsoleLogger](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-js/classes/consolelogger.html)\) – The interface used to leverage the console logging, or pass in a logger object to override the logging implementation\. The latter approach gives you different levels of logs from the SDK\.
