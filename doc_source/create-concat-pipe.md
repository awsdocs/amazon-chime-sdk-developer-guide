# Creating media concatenation pipelines<a name="create-concat-pipe"></a>

You use media concatenation pipelines to concatenate the artifacts \(files\) generated by media capture pipelines\.

Media capture pipelines capture the contents of a meeting by chunking the media streams and storing those artifacts in your S3 bucket\. Media capture pipelines create the following types of artifacts: 
+ Audio
+ Video
+ Content Share
+ Data Channel Messages
+ Transcription Messages
+ Meeting Events
+ Composited Video

Media concatenation pipelines allow you to concatenate each type of artifact into a single file, and then store those larger files in your S3 bucket\. You can create a media concatenation pipeline without waiting for the media capture event to end, but the concatenation pipeline only starts concatenating when the capture pipeline stops\.

**Note**  
Media capture pipelines, media concatenation pipelines, and S3 buckets must reside in the same AWS account\.
