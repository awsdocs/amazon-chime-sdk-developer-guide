# Server application architecture<a name="server-app-architecture"></a>

When a server receives a request from a client, it first ensures that the user is authorized to start or join a meeting\. The server uses the embedded AWS SDK in the language of choice to make [ chime:CreateMeeting ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime-sdk/latest/APIReference/API_CreateMeeting.html) and [ chime:CreateAttendee ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime-sdk/latest/APIReference/API_CreateAttendee.html) API calls to the global media control plane\. It does that to create the meeting and attendees in one of the supported AWS Regions\. To make these requests, the service needs the appropriate IAM user or role\. In turn, IAM users and roles need the [ AmazonChimeSDK ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime-sdk/latest/ag/security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.html) policy\.
