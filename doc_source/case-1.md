# Receiving an inbound call<a name="case-1"></a>

When a `NEW_INCOMING_CALL` event occurs, the PSTN Audio service creates a unique `TransactionID` and unique `CallID` that persist until the `HANGUP` event occurs\.

You can respond in several ways to a `NEW_INCOMING_CALL` event\. For example:
+ Send `PlayAudio` or `RecordAudio` actions and automatically answer the call\. 
+ Send a `Pause` action\.
+ Send a `Hangup` action, in which case the call isn’t answered and the customer isn’t charged\.
+ Send a `CallAndBridge` action and add another user to the call\.
+ Do nothing, the call attempt times out after 30 seconds\.

When a new inbound call is received, the SIP media application invokes an AWS Lambda function with this payload\.
