# Messaging architecture<a name="messaging-architecture"></a>

You can use Amazon Chime SDK messaging as a server\-side and a client\-side SDK\. The server\-side APIs create an `AppInstance` and `AppInstanceUser`\. You can use various hooks and configurations to add application specific business logic and validation\. For more information about doing that, see [Streaming messaging data](streaming-export.md)\. Additionally, server\-side processes can call APIs on behalf of an `AppInstanceUser`, or control a dedicated `AppInstanceUser` that represents backend processes\.

Client\-side applications represented as an `AppInstanceUser` can call the Amazon Chime SDK messaging APIs directly\. Client\-side applications use the WebSocket protocol to connect to the messaging SDK when they are online\. When connected, they receive real\-time messages from any channel that they are a member of\. When disconnected, an `AppInstanceUser` still belongs to the channels it was added to, and it can load the message history of those channels by using the SDK's HTTP based APIs\.

Client\-side applications have permissions to make API calls as a single `AppInstanceUser`\. To scope IAM credentials to a single `AppInstanceUser`, client side applications assume a parameterized IAM role via AWS Cognito Identity Pools, or by a small self\-hosted backend API\. For more information about authentication, see [Authenticating end\-user client applications](auth-client-apps.md)\. In contrast, server side applications typically have permissions tied to a single app instance user, such as a a user with administrative permissions, or they have permissions to make API calls on behalf of all app instance users\.
