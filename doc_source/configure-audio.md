# Configuring the audio folder<a name="configure-audio"></a>

The audio folder contains 5\-second MP4 files of the mixed audio stream, meaning they contain audio from all attendees, plus the active speakerâ€™s video\. The folder contains files for the entire meeting\. As desired, you can configure the folder to contain just the audio artifacts\. Each file name contains a *yyyy\-mm\-dd\-hour\-min\-seconds\-milleseconds* timestamp\. The timestamp is in UTC, and it marks the start time\. You can configure the folder to only contain audio artifacts\.
