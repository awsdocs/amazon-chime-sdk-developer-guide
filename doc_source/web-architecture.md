# Web application architecture<a name="web-architecture"></a>

You can serve your web application from a content delivery network, and load it when the user navigates to a URL in a browser\. You can also wrap it in a platform\-native Electron application that the user installs on their machine\. 

To join a new or existing meeting, the web application makes REST requests to the server application\. Typically, the requests carry an authorization token or a cookie that your application uses for other API requests\. You can also design your web client to send a region hint to the server, which the latter can use when providing the MediaRegion parameter to [ chime:CreateMeeting ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime-sdk/latest/APIReference/API_CreateMeeting.html)\. Your web application can determine the closest Amazon Chime media services region by making an HTTP GET request to the [ https://nearest\-media\-region\.l\.chime\.aws ](http://aws.amazon.com/https://nearest-media-region.l.chime.aws/) endpoint\.
