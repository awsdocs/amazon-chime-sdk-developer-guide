# Configuring your account<a name="configure-transcribe"></a>

Before you can use Amazon Chime SDK live transcription, you must grant Amazon Chime SDK permission to call Amazon Transcribe and Amazon Transcribe Medical in your AWS account\. You do that by adding the Chime Transcription service\-linked role to your account\. For information about creating the service\-linked role for live transcription, refer to [Using roles with live transcription](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime-sdk/latest/ag/using-service-linked-roles-transcription.html) in the *Amazon Chime SDK Administration Guide*\. For more information about IAM service\-linked roles, refer to [Service Linked Roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.
